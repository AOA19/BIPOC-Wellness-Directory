# What we built
Tech Stack: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
 <br />
We decided to create a mockup site for a BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) Wellness Directory. 

# Why?
We believe it addresses a deep need in the health and wellness space. It would provide an effortless resource for those seeking care and aid in reducing stigma and barriers to access around mental health.
